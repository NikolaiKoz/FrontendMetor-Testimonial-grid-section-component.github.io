## My process

  I decided to put everything inside a section tag to create a react component in the future.

  The first thing was to create a card, finished with it, copy and paste the same code five times.

  Only the first card has an addition that is a background image of some quotes, it is inside a picture tag.

  I decided to put everything inside a section tag to create a react component in the future.

  To finish, use grid to create a grid and establish the most similar layout to the images of the design.

  Also create a version for tablets.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

  This was an opportunity to learn how to use grid and flexbox in the same file, there are still properties that I don't use but to be my first experiment I think it's fine.

  NOTE: there is something in the paddings or margins that doesn't make me happy, I think it's the font size, the alignment or something, but the words don't jump lines when I would like



### Continued development

  As I already said, the cards are the same code repeated 5 times, I think it could be optimized with a React component, but since I don't know React, I don't have an opinion.



### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

  I thank myself, I want to be a programmer and although on many occasions I was tempted to look for a solution on YouTube, I am proud to have been able to solve this challenge alone, being self-taught is not easy, there is no marked path, I have been little less than a year trying to know what I should know, in short, the hypotenuse, but I like it, the frustration of hours disappears and is replaced by the maximum joy that a human being can experience when, through his own thought and reason, he manages to center a text in a div, at that time, we are able to touch a fragment of God.
